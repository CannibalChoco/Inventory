# Inventory
Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Project 10: Inventory App (Data Storage)

Goal of the project:

design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track
of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity
available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to
track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

Skills to learn from this project:

* Storing information in a SQLite database
* Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
* Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
* Updating information based on user input
* Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
